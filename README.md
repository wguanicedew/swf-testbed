# swf-testbed

This is the umbrella repository for the ePIC streaming workflow testbed: the streaming workflow
application of the swf platform. Its production peer is
[swf-epicprod](https://github.com/BNLNPPS/swf-epicprod); both ride the common platform in
[swf-monitor](https://github.com/BNLNPPS/swf-monitor) and
[swf-common-lib](https://github.com/BNLNPPS/swf-common-lib).

### MCP for Claude Code

This repository includes `.mcp.json` which automatically configures [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) to connect to the testbed's MCP service. When you open this project in Claude Code, the `swf-testbed` MCP server is available for natural language queries about system state, agents, workflows, and logs.

**SSL Setup (required for BNL/SDCC servers):** Add to your `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
```

To manually add the MCP server:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http swf-testbed https://pandaserver02.sdcc.bnl.gov/swf-monitor/mcp/
```

### Development
- [**Development Guide**](docs/development.md) - Contributing and development workflow
- [**AI Memory**](docs/ai-memory.md) - Cross-session dialogue persistence (experimental)

# Architecture Overview

System design and components of the SWF Testbed.

## Overview

The testbed plan is based on ePIC streaming computing model WG discussions
in the streaming computing model meeting[^1], guided by the ePIC streaming
computing model report[^2], and the ePIC workflow management system
requirements[^3].

## Testbed plan

The testbed prototypes the ePIC streaming computing model's workflows and
dataflows from Echelon 0 (E0) egress (the DAQ exit buffer)
through the processing that takes place at the two Echelon 1 computing
facilities at BNL and JLab.

The testbed scope, timeline and workplan are described in a planning
document[^4]. Detailed progress tracking and development discussion is in a
progress document[^5].

See the E0-E1 overview slide deck [^6] for more information on the E0-E1
workflow and dataflow.
The following is a schematic of the system the testbed targets (from the blue
DAQ external subnet rightwards).

## Design and implementation

Overall system design and implementation notes:

- We aim to follow the [Software Statement of Principles](https://eic.github.io/activities/principles.html) of the EIC and ePIC in the design and
  implementation of the testbed software.
- The implementation language is Python 3.9 or greater.
- Testbed modules are implemented as a set of loosely coupled agents, each
  with a specific role in the system.
- The agents communicate via messaging, using ActiveMQ as the message
  broker.
- The PanDA [^7] distributed workload management system and its ancillary
  components are used for workflow orchestration and workload execution.
- The Rucio [^8] distributed data management system is used for
  management and distribution of data and associated metadata, in close
  orchestration with PanDA.
- High quality monitoring and centralized management of system data (metadata,
  bookkeeping, logs etc.) is a primary design goal. Monitoring and system
  data gathering and distribution is implemented via a web service backed
  by a relational database, with a REST API for data access and reporting.

## Software organization

The streaming workflow (swf prefix) set of repositories make up the software for the ePIC
streaming workflow testbed project, development begun in June 2025.
This swf-testbed repository serves as the umbrella repository for the testbed.
It's the central place for documentation, overall configuration,
and high-level project information.

The repositories mapping to testbed components are:

### [swf-monitor](https://github.com/BNLNPPS/swf-monitor)

The common monitor, web, and database services of the swf platform, serving the testbed and the epicprod production system: browser-based dashboards, a JSON REST API, and the database-backed state beneath them.

This module manages the databases used by the testbed, and offers a REST API for other agents in the system to report status and retrieve information. It acts as a listener for the ActiveMQ message broker, receiving messages from other agents, storing relevant data in the database and presenting message histories in the monitor. It hosts a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the agents to share information with LLM clients to create an intelligent assistant for the testbed. Production applications ship from [swf-epicprod](https://github.com/BNLNPPS/swf-epicprod) and run installed within the monitor's runtime.

### [swf-daqsim-agent](https://github.com/BNLNPPS/swf-daqsim-agent)

This is the information agent designed to simulate the Data Acquisition (DAQ)
system and other EIC machine and ePIC detector influences on streaming
processing. This dynamic simulator acts as the primary input and driver of
activity within the testbed.

### [swf-data-agent](https://github.com/BNLNPPS/swf-data-agent)

This is the central data handling agent within the testbed. It listens to
the swf-daqsim-agent, manages Rucio subscriptions of run datasets and STF
files, create new run datasets, and sends messages to the
swf-processing-agent for run processing and to the swf-fastmon-agent for new
STF availability. It will also have a 'watcher' role to identify and report
stalls or anomalies.

### [swf-processing-agent](https://github.com/BNLNPPS/swf-processing-agent)

This is the prompt processing agent that configures and submits PanDA
processing jobs to execute the streaming workflows of the testbed.

### [swf-fastmon-agent](https://github.com/BNLNPPS/swf-fastmon-agent)

This is the fast monitoring agent designed to consume (fractions of) STF data
for quick, near real-time monitoring. This agent will reside at the E1s and perform
remote data reads from STF files in the DAQ exit buffer, skimming a fraction
of the data of interest for fast monitoring. The agent will be notified of new
STF availability by the swf-data-agent.

### [swf-mcp-agent](https://github.com/BNLNPPS/swf-mcp-agent)

This agent may be added in the future for managing Model Context Protocol
(MCP) services. For the moment, this is done in swf-monitor (colocated with
the agent data the MCP services provide).

Note Paul Nilsson's [ask-panda example](https://github.com/PalNilsson/ask-panda) of
MCP server and client; we want to integrate it into the testbed. Tadashi Maeno has also implemented MCP capability on the core PanDA services, we will want to integrate that as well.

### Testbed System Architecture

### Deployment Modes

The testbed supports two deployment modes:

**Development Mode** (Docker-managed infrastructure):
- PostgreSQL and ActiveMQ run as Docker containers
- Managed by `docker-compose.yml`
- Started/stopped via `swf-testbed start/stop`
- Ideal for development and testing environments

**System Mode** (System-managed infrastructure):
- PostgreSQL and ActiveMQ run as system services (e.g., `postgresql-16.service`, `artemis.service`)
- Managed by system service manager (systemd)
- Testbed manages only agent processes via `swf-testbed start-local/stop-local`
- Typical for shared development systems like pandaserver02

Both modes use supervisord to manage Python agent processes. Use `python report_system_status.py` to verify service availability and determine which mode is active.

### Database Schema
The database schema for the monitoring system is automatically maintained in the swf-monitor repository. View the current schema:
- [testbed-schema.dbml](https://github.com/BNLNPPS/swf-monitor/blob/main/testbed-schema.dbml)

To generate the schema manually:
```bash
cd swf-monitor/src
python manage.py dbml > ../testbed-schema.dbml
```

To visualize the schema, paste the DBML content into [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/).

### Agent Identity Management

The testbed uses a global sequential agent ID system to ensure unique agent identification:

**Agent Naming Convention:**
- Format: `{agent_type}-agent-{username}-{sequential_id}`
- Examples: `data-agent-wenauseic-1`, `processing-agent-wenauseic-2`, `daq-simulator-wenauseic-3`

**Sequential ID Assignment:**
- Global counter shared across all agent types
- Stored in PersistentState database model
- Thread-safe atomic assignment via `SELECT FOR UPDATE`
- API endpoint: `/api/state/next-agent-id/`

**Benefits:**
- Guaranteed unique agent names across the system
- Easy tracking of agent generations over time
- No collision risk even with concurrent agent startups
- Human-readable sequential numbering (1, 2, 3...)

This replaces the previous random suffix approach and ensures long-term uniqueness as the system scales.

### Namespace Isolation

Namespaces provide logical isolation for workflows and agents:

- **Purpose**: Allow users to discriminate their workflows from others and from other users
- **Scope**: All workflow messages include namespace for filtering
- **Configuration**: Set in `workflows/testbed.toml` before running workflows
- **Collaboration**: Multiple users can share a namespace for collaborative work
- **UI Integration**: Monitor UI supports namespace filtering on agents, executions, and messages

Example namespace configuration:
```toml
[testbed]
namespace = "epic-fastmon-dev"
```

### Workflow Definition Architecture

The testbed implements a three-layer workflow architecture to support both complex orchestration and agile parameter experimentation:

**Layer 1: Snakemake (Complex Workflows)**
- For complex multi-facility workflows with dependencies
- Handles orchestration-heavy scenarios (e.g., calibration workflows)
- Integrates with PanDA for distributed execution
- Used when workflow logic involves conditional execution and complex dependencies

**Layer 2: TOML Configuration (Parameter Management)**
- Human-readable parameter definitions for workflow variants
- Supports systematic experimentation and comparison
- Version control friendly for tracking parameter evolution
- Enables rapid iteration on workflow configurations

**Layer 3: Python + SimPy (Execution Engine)**
- Direct SimPy integration for simulation and execution
- Native Python expressiveness for workflow logic
- Real-time parameter-driven execution
- Optimized for fast processing workflows requiring rapid experimentation

**Workflow Type Classification:**
- **Fast Processing Workflows**: Use TOML + Python+SimPy (Layers 2 & 3) for rapid experimentation with worker counts, processing targets, and sampling rates
- **Complex Orchestration Workflows**: Use all three layers when sophisticated dependency management and multi-facility coordination are required

This architecture maintains testbed agility while supporting both simple parameter experiments and complex production-like workflows.

**Workflow Steps:**
1. **Run Start** - daqsim-agent generates a run start broadcast message indicating a new datataking run is beginning
2. **Dataset Creation** - data-agent sees the run start message and has Rucio create a dataset for the run
3. **Processing Task** - processing-agent sees the run start message and establishes a PanDA processing task for the run
4. **STF Available** - daqsim-agent generates a broadcast message that a new STF data file is available
5. **STF Transfer** - data-agent sees the message and initiates Rucio registration and transfer of the STF file to E1 facilities
6. **STF Processing** - processing-agent sees the new STF file in the dataset and transferred to the E1 by Rucio, and initiates a PanDA job to process the STF
7. **Fast Monitoring** - fastmon-agent sees the broadcast message that a new STF data file is available and performs a partial read to inject a data sample into E1/E2 fast monitoring

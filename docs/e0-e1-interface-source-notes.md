# E0-E1 Interface — Source Notes

Extracts from the primary sources on the E0-E1 interface, for reference by
the interface documents in this repository. Each extract cites its source;
the sources are authoritative, these notes are the working digest.

## The interface open questions (July 2026)

Next step: formalize the E0-E1 interface in the Streaming Computing Model
report, with detailed technical notes as needed. Target: September 2026.

Main open questions as presented:

- Raw-data and STF definitions and timeline
- Evolution of the state model and transition rules
- Latency requirements
- Calibration and conditions databases
- Information and control interfaces between E0 and E1
- AI readiness and AI-enabled control

## The DAQ run-control model

From the DAQ overview (Echelon 0 software design):

- The state model incorporates continuously running components (scalers
  are the example).
- A "run" structure configures and selects the enabled detectors.
- Slow-controls status is part of the state model.

This is the E0-side model the
[E0-E1 state machine](e0-e1-state-machine.md) converges with.

## E0-E1 interface concepts (DAQ side)

- Time frames are buffers of multiplexed whole-detector data covering
  ~0.6 ms; super time frames are ordered, contiguous sets of O(1000) time
  frames, roughly 0.6 s of detector data.
- Likely independent DAQ systems, each with an independent STF stream:
  polarimetry (n × 1260 values, presented infrequently), luminosity
  detectors (n × 1260 values, each second), and the ePIC detector
  (100 Gbps).
- On run start/stop, the DAQ notifies orchestration of detector/collider
  status via message; on STF production it writes the file to the buffer
  box and notifies orchestration of data availability via message.
- Data banks: raw banks are produced by the readout, processing adds new
  banks without modifying existing ones, and a fraction of raw banks is
  always retained.
- Echelon 0 scale: O(100) readout computers in the DAQ room and O(100)
  computers at the SDCC data center for time frame building, high-level
  filters, archiving, monitoring, logging, and QA.

## Streaming reconstruction and event finding

From the streaming reconstruction talk
([T. Kumaoka et al.](https://indico.bnl.gov/event/31808/contributions/127067/))
and the streaming readout AI background suppression talk
([D. Romanov et al.](https://indico.bnl.gov/event/31808/contributions/126682/)),
July 2026 workfest:

- Vocabulary: simulation-side work organizes data in ~2 µs frames
  (Kumaoka's "time-frame (2 µs)", Romanov's 2000 ns frames) — the
  MAPS-integration sense of "time frame" noted in the DAQ overview,
  distinct from the 0.6 ms DAQ TF.
- Triggerless readout means events are identified in software. Kumaoka:
  time splitting into ~20 ns slices; per-detector-set hit thresholds
  trigger candidate slices (pre-identification), then track/vertex-level
  event identification and ML classification in EICrecon. Scale at top
  rates: ~300 DIS events and ~2×10⁶ background events per TF.
- Romanov: per-hit classification hits a ceiling — individual signal and
  background hits look identical — so window finding is the key step: a
  CNN + attention window finder locates the interaction burst in time,
  then in-window hit filtering. 99% signal retention, tracking up to 6.5×
  faster; integrated in EICrecon as an ONNX plugin and run on the 26.07.0
  campaign.
- Common pattern: the event finder examines consecutive time intervals,
  and physics signatures extend across interval boundaries — MAPS
  integration (2–8 µs) above all — so the data processed together must be
  contiguous and time-ordered.

## The DAQ AI-readiness plan

From the DAQ overview (AI requirements): AI is not a project requirement
for the DAQ but is a potentially enormously useful tool for attaining the
project requirements; the group is searching for concrete ways to make the
electronics/DAQ "AI ready". The specific answers as of July 2026:

- Specific ML algorithms for specific features (e.g. dRICH dark current
  reduction in firmware).
- MCP servers to make data accessible to LLMs: slow controls readout,
  EIC Controls readout (monthly discussions with EIC Controls), DAQ
  monitoring/logging, and run log database information.
- MCP servers to provide APIs to allow LLMs (potentially) to control DAQ
  run control features.
- The SRO WG orchestration testbed as the model.

These items, together with the deployed Echelon 1 MCP service
(`swf-monitor/docs/MCP.md`), define the MCP-based AI backplane spanning
machine, DAQ, and global computing. The backplane figure lives with the
MCP service documentation in swf-monitor:
